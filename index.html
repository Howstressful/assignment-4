        <h1><b>Hey hey, here are some cool facts about animals</b></h1>
        <p><b>Komodo Dragons</b>. Perhaps the coolest animal in the animal kingdom. Not only does this creature stand at the apex of all animals there are many other interesting facts about it as well.</p>

        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>They are the biggest living reptaile alive.</li>
        <li>Mostly scavengers. But they can pretty much kill anything. This is due to 1 their super strong bite force, and 2 the blood melting toxic they produce in their mouths</li>
        <li>A single swing from it's tail is comparable to a sludge hammer.</li>
        <li>Here's the really intersting thing doe. Not only can they consume almost their entire body weight in one sitting. And will quite literally eat rotting corspe, theres one thing they won't eat. This is the stomachs of the prey they kill. The actauly theory is they refuse to eat the vegtable's in the stomach of the animals they hunt. And I can respect that.</li>
        <li>One of the funniest things about komodo dragons has to be how selfish they are. If a komodo is eatting and another one appeares to try and still it's food. The dragon will shove all the food it can in it's mouth, and slam it's head in an attempt to eat as much food as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><b>Second best</b></h2>
        <p><b>Honey badgers</b> are perhaps the second coolest animal on earth. You may laugh at this statment but i've got the facts to prove this.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ok, ok heres the thing while the Honey Badger isn't as strong or as deadly as the Komodo dragon. It is perhaps the second most dangerous creature to face on this earth due to the fact that it's everythign proof. The skin surronding it is so thick, tuff, and loose that it's bacsically invincible.<li>
        <li>The honey badger regualarly hunts the Puff Adder which has venom that makes flesh necrotic and melt off. While not being immune to the venom the snakes bite can't penetrate it</li>
        <li>They have been know to sometimes emasulate lions. They let lions bite their necks, and while the lions mouth is full they actually move around in their own skin and attack the lion.</li>
        <li>Also fun fact their skin makes them bacsically bullet proof and mechete proof.</li>    
        <li>It's highly advised to just avoide this animal by all means unless you're <em>100%</em> sure you can get a <b>head shot</b> with a shot gun to actually stop it.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3><b>More dangerous then you think</b></h3>
        <p><b>Orca's or Killer Whales, once of the worst actaul animals in the ocean</b></p>

        <br></br>
    <ul>
        <li>A lot of people actaully find these things cute and gentle. O no Orca's are actually huge dicks.</li>
        <li>They regually hunt great white sharks. They do this by fliping them upside down which drowns them and literally only eating the liver, and leave. When this happens every shark for miles just leave the area.</li>
        <li>A shark named tip fin was taged, and during a killer whale hunt of one of it's own just dove 1 mile down and swam to hawii.</li>
        <li>They intentially beach themselves to catch seal.</li>
        <li>It's been observed that killer whales also hunt blue whales. They do this by straddling it's flanks and for hours attempt to drown it by body slamming it over, and over, and over.</li>
        <li>Bonus they hunt moose, and they don't mess with people because they find us boring.</li>
    </ul>
